Welcome to the homepage for the ECS [COMP6237 Data Mining](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/module/COMP6237) module.

The challenge of data mining is to transform raw data into useful information and actionable knowledge. Data mining is the computational process of discovering patterns in data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and data management. 

This course will introduce key concepts in data mining, information extraction and information indexing; including specific algorithms and techniques for feature extraction, clustering, outlier detection, topic modelling and prediction of complex unstructured data sets. By taking this course you will be given a broad view of the general issues surrounding unstructured and semi-structured data and the application of algorithms to such data. At a practical level you will have the chance to explore an assortment of data mining techniques which you will apply to problems involving real-world data. 

## Lectures
The lectures for this course will be given by <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/sh7n18">Dr Sarah Hewitt</a> ([email](mailto:sarah.hewitt@soton.ac.uk)) and <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/mb8">Dr Markus Brede</a> ([email](mailto:mb8@ecs.soton.ac.uk)). 

The lecture slots are as follows:

Day        | Time | Room   
-----------|------|-----------------------
Mondays    | 4PM	| 58/1067 (Murray)
Tuesdays	 | 11AM	| 29/1101 (Graham Hills)
Thursdays	 | 4PM	| 58/1067 (Murray)
Fridays	   | 11AM	| 29/1101 (Graham Hills)

There will generally be three lectures each week, making use of the Monday, Tuesday and Friday slots. For some of the weeks we will also use the Thursday slot. 

When we are not using sessions for formal teaching, the rooms are available for you to use for the group project. At those times both Sarah & Markus will endeavour to be in their respective offices should you wish to get assistance with any aspects of the course (it is advisable to email us before to give us a heads-up that you're coming though). 

The current timetable is shown below - be aware that this might change (especially if you ask us to add additional tutorial sessions):

## Where to get additional help
Talk to us! As we said above, you are more than welcome to arrange to meet with us in the unused lecture slots (or at other times if necessary) to discuss issues related to the course. <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/sh7n18">Sarah</a> ([email](mailto:sarah.hewitt@soton.ac.uk)) and <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/mb8">Markus</a> ([email](mailto:mb8@ecs.soton.ac.uk)) can both be reached by email or by coming to find us in our offices (32/3017 for Sarah & 32/4033 for Markus). 

For further practical help, you can also talk with the PhD students, who run the help desk in the Zepler lab.
